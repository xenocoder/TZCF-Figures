Temperature - 

Temperature at STFZ - Each year different. 2008 Gradual thermocline, 2011 closet but steeper, 2009 very steep and deepest mixed layer at ~110m. Everything converges around 130m.

Temperature at TZCF - 2008 and 2009 close, 2008 more gradual mixing, 2009 still steeper. 2011 much warmer to depth based on position further to the south. No real convergence at depth but much closer around 140m. 

Density - 

Density at STFZ - 2008 and 2011 similar and reflect temperature, but actually closer together. 2009 less dense to depth and looks like temperature profile down to 100m. 2009 and 2011 converge past 140m.

Density at STFZ - Salinity changes cause 2009 and 2011 to be comparable to 80m, then they split. 2008 gradual increase in density to depth, less extreme changes at depth than 2009. 2009 and 2009 converge at 180m.

Salinity - 

Salinity at STFZ - All three years different down to 100m, where 2009 and 2011 converge to depth. 2008 different down to 200m. 

Salinity at TZCF - All three years different down to 100m. 2008 and 2009 converge from 100-140m, then 2008 and 2011 converge from 140-200m. 

Fluorescence - 

Fluorescence at STFZ - 2008 has shallower DCM at 90m. 2011 has next shallowest at 100m and 2009 is similar around 105m, but a smaller peak.

Fluorescence at TZCF - 2008 is shallowest DCM again at 40m. 2011 and 2009 similar but 2011 has DCM from40-100m and 2009 center at 60m. 2009 and 2008 peaks are similar in magnitude and greater than 2011.

Nutrients - 

Nitrate+Nitrite at STFZ - All three years have very little nitrate down to 70m, where nitrate begins to increase in 2008. 2009 and 2011 similar and no nitrate down to 100m, with all three increasing with depth in order of magnitude 2008, 2009, and 2011. Nutricline (1 umol/kg) in 2008 at ~80m and ~110m in 2009 and 2011.

Nitrate+Nitrite at TZCF - All three similar down to 70m, then 2009 increases greatly at depth while 2008 and 2011 track each other. Nutricline ~75m in all three years.

Blue-green algae - 

Prochlorococcus at STFZ - Deep peak at 80m in 2008, peaks around 100m in 2009 and 2011. Concentrations drop off around 150-200m in all years (problem in 2008). More in 2008 than other two years.

Prochlorococcus at TZFC - Large concentration in 2008 down to 60m, DCM peak in 2009 at 60m and a smaller magnitude peak centered at 50m in 2011. Concentrations drop off around 100-120m in all years (problem in 2008). Again larger concentration in 2008 than other years.

Synechococcus at STFZ - Much smaller concentration than prochlorococcus. Concentrations from off around 120m in all years. Higher concentration in 2011 than other years. 2011 DCM peak around 90m, 2008 and 2009 no real peak just gradual decline.

Synechococcus at TZCF - Highest concentration (not by much) in 2009 with DCM peak at 40m. Similar peak at 40m in 2011 just lower concentration. Similar concentration in 2008 but shallower peak at 20m.

Picoeukaryotes - 

Pelagophytes at STFZ - Greater concentration in 2008 and 2011 than 2009. Similar DCM peaks in 2009 and 2011 at 100m, with DCM peak in 2008 at 80m. 

Pelagophytes at TZCF - Less concentration in 2009 than 2008 and 2011. Similar concentrations in 2008 and 2011 with deeper DCM peak in 2011. Both 2008 and 2011 peaks at 80m, but 2011 extends deeper

Prymnesiophytes at STFZ - Similar concentrations in all three years but shallower DCM peak at 80m in 2008 and around 100m in 2009 and 2011. 

Prymnesiophytes at TZCF - Greater concentration in 2008 with DCM peak at 40m. 2009 and 2011 had similar profiles with a DCM peak at 60m.

Eukaryotes - 

Dinoflagellates at STFZ - Hardly any concentration in any years. Slightly greater in 2011 between 40-120m.

Dinoflagellates at TZCF - DCM peak at 50m in 2008, very small concentrations in 2008 and 2011 but small amounts from 0-80m in 2009 ad 0-120m in 2011.

Diatoms at STFZ - Small concentrations at depth, with slightly larger concentrations in 209 and 2011 with DCM peak at 100m. 

Diatoms at TZCF - All three years had some concentration, with greatest to depth in 2011 with  a peak at 80m. 2008 was similar but concentration got smaller at depths greater than 40m. Overall smaller concentration in 2009 but peak at 60m to almost same concentration as 2011.
