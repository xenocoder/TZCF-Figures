To DO

1. Combine Figures 1&2 - Tonight
2. Combine T, NO3, Fluor figure - Tonight
3. Remove total chla from profiles -Tonight
4. One figure for bar charts - Tonight 
5. T-test median cell size across fronts (couple with 7).
6. Frontal composition correlates to median cell size. Stable over time
7. March positions vary but no significant trend (show mean and var, r2,p). High variability (show mean and var for STFZ and TZCF)
8. Cell size doesn't change within fronts over time (show r2 and p)
9. Do bar chart of P, N, M% grouped by front. Compute mean of %pico/nano/micro and std. Then double for CI. DO FIRST!!!
10. Some statistical way to show whether %relationship holds across year and front (ANOVE of %pico with year and front, %nano? Cluster?) DO NEXT!!!

How do we show where the variability is significant across either front, year, for phytoplankton size classes.

picoplankton ~ year + zone
nanoplankton ~ year + zone 
microplankton ~ year + zone

We can see that 2009 is different at TZCF both in terms of chla concentration as well as being 50%/50% pico nano at depth (seen in Figure with PSC profiles)
